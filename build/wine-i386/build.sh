# Build the 32-bit (i386) Windows farm that WoW64 sessions load:
# app/Madeira/i386-windows/.
#
# This is the macOS form of the WSL stage script the 32-bit work was built
# with. It follows the conventions of build/wine-pe/build-ntdll.sh (the
# llvm-mingw toolchain under toolchains/, a separate wine/build-<arch> tree) and
# has NOT been run on macOS yet: the logic is the WSL script's, the paths and
# tool invocations are translated. See docs/WOW64.md, "Building".
#
#   build/wine-i386/build.sh                 whole farm + DXMT's i386 DLLs
#   build/wine-i386/build.sh kernel32 user32 only those Wine modules
#   SKIP_DXMT=1 build/wine-i386/build.sh     Wine modules only
#
# What goes in, and why it is not a hand-written list: a 32-bit program that
# imports one missing DLL never reaches its first instruction
# ("import_dll Library FOO.dll ... not found"), and there is no way to find the
# gap except by running that exact program. So the farm is EVERY module this
# configured i386 tree has a rule for, minus the SKIP list below, each entry
# with its reason. The import-closure report at the end names anything still
# missing.
#
# DXMT owns d3d11/dxgi/d3d10core/winemetal on i386 as on 64-bit: Wine's own
# d3d11/dxgi/d3d10core are wined3d frontends and wined3d has no backend in this
# port (no OpenGL, --without-vulkan), so those are never installed from Wine.
# d3d9 is DXMT's too: its thin shim ships as d3d9.dll and forwards to the
# emulated frontend (d3d9-emulated.dll) unless madeira.cfg says d3d9 = native.
