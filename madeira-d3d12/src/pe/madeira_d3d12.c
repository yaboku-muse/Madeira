/*  madeira-d3d12: M2 native D3D12 ABI slice.
 *
 *  The minimum set of objects the design's M2 gate names: a device that can
 *  create a queue, an allocator, a command list and a fence; a list that can be
 *  recorded, closed and reset; a queue that can execute it and signal; and a
 *  fence that reports completion and wakes a Win32 event waiter.
 *
 *  There is deliberately no Metal here yet. M2 is about the COM ABI, object
 *  lifetime and synchronisation being right, and mixing GPU work into that would
 *  make a failure ambiguous between the two. The buffer-copy/readback test comes
 *  next and gives the fence something real to be synchronising.
 *
 *  Every vtable is fully populated from generated stubs first, then implemented
 *  methods are assigned over them. So the supported surface is exactly the list
 *  of assignments below, and anything else returns E_NOTIMPL and names itself.

 * that name the same offset accumulate. Nothing is promised across passes, so
 * this follows DXMT's D3D11 implementation exactly: a fresh 8-byte slot starts
 * whenever the set of active queries changes or an encoder ends, every draw
 * counts into the current slot, and a query's value is the CPU-side sum of the
 * slots between its Begin and its End, taken once the command buffer has
 * completed -- before the fence the game waits on advances (mad_cb_retire runs
 * ahead of the fence signal on the same worker). The slots live in 64 KB chunks
 * from the argument-ring pool, owned by the BATCH (command buffer), not by a
 * list, so nothing rewinds them before they are read.
 *
 * ResolveQueryData therefore delivers real values into the readback buffer on
 * the CPU. The constant "1 sample, visible" that stood in before this is what
 * kept every lens flare and light sprite at full strength through walls and in
 * daylight: their brightness is the occlusion fraction the game reads back. */

 *
 * Mode 1 makes every encoder wait for the whole previous one: ~260 full GPU
 * drains a frame in RDR2 (ph-rdr89), ~200 of them compute encoders that a
 * ResourceBarrier closed. With the fences off, GPU time per frame halved
 * (ph-rdr63/70) but rendering broke; after the power clamp the GPU is ~90 %
 * busy and the frame is GPU-bound, so that stall time is now the frame.
 *
 * D3D12's own rule is narrower than mode 1: work may overlap unless a barrier
 * separates it, except that writes to the same render target or depth buffer
 * stay ordered without one. Mode 6 follows that rule:
 *  - every encoder updates its OWN fence (a per-queue pool of 64) and joins
 *    the queue's pending set when it ends;
 *  - an encoder begun after a barrier or at a list start waits for EVERY
 *    pending encoder and empties the set: it is a sync point, and anything
 *    older is covered transitively through the sync point before it;
 *  - an encoder begun with no barrier since the last one waits for nothing,
 *    unless it is a pass whose attachments a pending encoder wrote, a blit
 *    after a pending blit, or the set is full;
 *  - at a barrier, an open encoder that did NOT sync at its start is closed,
 *    so what follows the barrier starts a new encoder, which syncs. A compute
 *    encoder that DID sync stays open: its serial dispatch orders the
 *    dispatches after the barrier behind the ones before it, and the encoder
 *    boundary mode 1 put at every barrier is gone (madeira.cfg
 *    f6-compute-open = 0 closes it anyway, for isolating a defect);
 *  - the device fence carries cross-queue and cross-batch order: it is waited
 *    for at the first sync of every list, and updated only by a join encoder
 *    at commit that waits for everything pending, so "the device fence
 *    passed" still means "every earlier batch finished", as in mode 1. The
 *    Present blit waits for it too. */

 * ml1008: the DXBC/SM5.x binding bridge.
 *
 * The two backends bind through entirely different layouts. Apple's converter
 * reads ONE top-level argument buffer in which a descriptor-table root argument
 * is the absolute GPU address of its first descriptor. Our DXBC compiler
 * instead reads TWO argument buffers at fixed Metal buffer indices (reported as
 * ConstanttBufferTableBindIndex / ArgumentBufferBindIndex, measured at 29 and
 * 30), each a flat array of 64-bit words: a resource lands at its reflected
 * StructurePtrOffset, which is a WORD index, and occupies one to three words
 * depending on its kind.
 *
 * So for these pipelines the runtime has to resolve each declaration range to a
 * real descriptor itself. Two traps, both measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - The reflected slot is the declaration RANGE ID, not the register. Under
 *    SM 5.1 those differ, and in 22 of the 24 captured shaders they do: range
 *    id 0 means b17 / t104 / u1. Binding by the range id binds the wrong
 *    resource with a perfectly clean compile, which is why the range identity
 *    is carried separately in madeira_ir_air_range::lower_bound.
 *
 *  - The compiler's resource lookups take a dynamic index and discard it, so a
 *    multi-element range would silently collapse onto its first descriptor.
 *    Those are refused in the conversion service, before a pipeline exists.

 * D3D12CreateRootSignatureDeserializer and its versioned sibling turn a

 * blob through one before CreateRootSignature, so the old E_NOTIMPL meant no
 * pipeline was ever created. The reader follows device_CreateRootSignature's
 * rules -- the same chunk lookup, version check, range stride and bounds --
 * but fills the public D3D12 structures instead of the converter's.
 *
 * Both description versions are built once, at creation, each in one heap
 * block the object owns. Every pointer handed out therefore stays valid until
 * the last Release, and no method allocates or races another thread.
 *
 * Converting 1.0 up to 1.1 uses the flags D3D12 defines as 1.0's behaviour:
 * ranges DESCRIPTORS_VOLATILE (plus DATA_VOLATILE unless they hold samplers),
 * root descriptors DATA_VOLATILE. Converting 1.1 down to 1.0 drops the flags.
 * MADEIRA_D3D12_RS_DESERIALIZER=0 restores the old E_NOTIMPL. */

/* ---- TILED RESOURCES (opt-in, madeira.cfg d3d12-tiled-resources = 1) -----
 * Feature level 12_0 requires TiledResourcesTier 2 on Windows. An engine that
 * checks its feature-level survey for consistency (GTA V Enhanced, "feature
 * level 12_0" in its ERR_GFX_D3D_NOD3D12 box) refuses a device that claims
 * 12_0 but answers OPTIONS.TiledResourcesTier 0,
 * OPTIONS.MaxGPUVirtualAddressBitsPerResource 0 (while
 * GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_SUPPORT says 40) and fails FORMAT_SUPPORT for the
 * R32G32B32 vertex formats. With the key set:
 *   - OPTIONS reports TiledResourcesTier 2 and 40 address bits per resource,
 *     FORMAT_SUPPORT gives R32G32B32_FLOAT/UINT/SINT IA_VERTEX_BUFFER;
 *   - CreateReservedResource(1,2) create the resource FULLY BACKED, exactly as
 *     a committed resource in a DEFAULT heap, so every tile has memory of its
 *     own; d3d12-reserved-max-mb (default 1024) refuses larger ones with
 *     E_OUTOFMEMORY before anything is allocated;
 *   - GetResourceTiling answers D3D12's standard tiling (64 KB tiles, standard
 *     shapes, Tier 2 mip packing, per-slice packed mips);
 *   - UpdateTileMappings / CopyTileMappings are no-ops.
 * Deviation from Tier 2: a tile the application never mapped reads what the
 * backing holds, not zeros, and writes to it are kept. Without the key every
 * method here is the generated stub and every answer above is unchanged.
 * Real residency could later come from Metal sparse textures or Metal 4
 * placement sparse resources, whose mappings take tiles of a heap. */
