"""The starting screen of a Madeira Dock start (app/Madeira/DockStartScreen.swift), on the host.

1. Swift: compiles the production rules (SteamLaunchScene, SteamLaunchHold,
   DockStartStatus) and checks which window a Dock start shows, decided by where
   the owning program lives (fixtures shaped like the census of a Dock session),
   when the starting screen hides or shows the desktop, and the status texts.
2. C: extracts the window census from app/Madeira/Winios/Winios.m and drives it
   with stubbed driver helpers under ASan/UBSan, then concurrently under
   ThreadSanitizer: top-level windows only, one path lookup per process, frames
   and swapchains, capacity, and the born-minimized restore (once, only for a
   window never shown, only while the census runs, MADEIRA_RESTORE_BORN_MINIMIZED=0
   off).
3. C: extracts winios_drv_process_image from build/win32u-unix/driver_ios.c and
   checks the path form the rules read.
4. Source checks: wiring into the library, the glyph row, no program-name lists,
   the Xcode project, licence headers.

Synthetic data only: no Wine, Steam or credentials.
