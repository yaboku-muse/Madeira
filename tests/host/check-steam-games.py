"""Steam games in the library (app/Madeira/SteamGames.swift), on the host.

1. Swift: compiles the production SteamGamesRules with Madeira Dock's production
   discovery (MadeiraDock.games / game(manifest:), sliced as in
   check-dock-contract.py, and SteamKeyValues.swift) and checks, on a synthetic
   drive_c laid out as Steam's client writes it, that installed and partly
   installed games are found, plus the section, search, Play-blocker, card
   pill and artwork rules, the merge of installed and owned games (owned games
   come from the production SteamOwnedGame and SteamAppInfo), and the program
   an installed game's pills describe.
2. Source checks: the section uses Dock's discovery and Dock's launch path
   only (no environment, sign-in transfer, token or Wine call of its own), no
   program-name list, no account data in a log line, wired into the library,
   built by the Xcode project; an installed game's card shows the library
   pills, read once per install and kept on its library entry.

Synthetic data only: no Steam, Wine or credentials.
